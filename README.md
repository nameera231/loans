# loans

Problem 1:

 The balance for the next month is computed by the formula:

new balance = old balance + interest - payment
Write a program that reads from the terminal window the initial balance of a loan, the monthly interest rate, and the constant monthly payment. Have the program print a labeled table showing the month number and the balance at the beginning of that month (the balance at the beginning of the month 1 is the amount borrowed). Continue printing until a payment would cause the balance to drop to zero or below. Also print the final payment necessary to close the loan, the total amount made in payments, and the "cost" of the loan (total payments - loan).
